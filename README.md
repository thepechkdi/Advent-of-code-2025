Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository!
This project contains my daily Python solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, focusing on:

🧠 Algorithmic problem-solving

🧩 Clean and modular code

📦 Organized folder structure

✨ Readable, maintainable solutions for Part 1 & Part 2

Each day is implemented in a separate folder and includes:

part1.py — solution for Part 1

part2.py — solution for Part 2

input.txt — my personal puzzle input

You can navigate to any day and run the code independently. No external dependencies — everything uses Python's standard library.

🚀 Running a Solution

From terminal:

cd day04
python part1.py
python part2.py


Make sure you're using Python 3.10+.

🧠 Daily Progress Tracker
Day	Part 1	Part 2	Notes
1	⭐ Completed	⭐ Completed	Dial rotation & modular arithmetic
2	⭐ Completed	⭐ Completed	Pattern repetition & string analysis
3	⭐ Completed	⭐ Completed	Sorting & greedy combination logic
4	⭐ Completed	⭐ Completed	Grid scanning, simulation, adjacency rules
5	⏳ Coming soon	⏳ Coming soon	—

🧩 Code Philosophy

I aim for:

Readable code over overly clever tricks

Modular functions that can be reused

Comments & clarity for future reference

Efficient algorithms where needed

Separation of input and logic to keep things clean

🔧 Utilities Folder (utils/)

This folder contains helper modules used across multiple days:

grid.py → Grid navigation helpers

parsing.py → Input parsing utilities

__init__.py → Package initializer

These utilities avoid repeating code and make solutions cleaner.

🎯 Goals for This Project

Solve all 25 days

Maintain high-quality, professional code

Learn new patterns & techniques

Share progress publicly to grow my developer portfolio

Enjoy the challenge ❤️
