Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository!
This project contains my daily Python solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, focusing on:

🧠 Algorithmic problem-solving

🧩 Clean and modular code

📦 Organized folder structure

✨ Readable, maintainable solutions for Part 1 & Part 2

Each day is implemented in a separate folder and includes:

part1.py — solution for Part 1

part2.py — solution for Part 2

input.txt — my personal puzzle input
